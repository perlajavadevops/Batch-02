Arrays:
1. Will allow similar type of data.
2. arrays size is fixed. 5. --> ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException(runtime exception).
3. arrays start index is '0'.
4. arrays are objects in java lang.
5. we can create arrsys. int[] arr = new int[10];
6. in single line initialize arrays: int[] arr1 = {2,4,5,67,7,8,9} 
7. to get the arrays size we need to 'length' property.
8. it is maintianing type safety.
9. arrays are random access.
10. arrays will allow duplicates also.


1. Remove duplicates from arrays and print uniqe data.
2. print only duplicates from arrays.
3. write a program to print in order ( ascending or decending order) 
		
4. write a program to search given element ie.20 by using binary search and lear seach. ex: {1,2,5,20,30,10}
5. FIFO  ->Queqe  ex: {1,2,5,20,30,10} using arrays.
6. Stack -> Last in first out
